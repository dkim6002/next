# Next.fm

Next.fm is an app to generate playlists using the last.fm API. This is a group project for General Assembly Web Development Immersive 2 in Washington, DC. Team members are Sam Barrientos, Daniel Kim, Stephen Neubig, Chris Pollock, Clare Politano, and Lisa Snider, with guidance from instructor Jesse Shawl.

## Essential
The client likes listening to new music, but doesn't want to take time to manage playlists. Instead, the client would like to search for one track, play it, then automatically generate a list of similar tracks. The queue of upcoming tracks should be editable, with the ability to remove unwanted songs. Importantly, the user should be able to save a great playlist for later. Playlist should contain about 10 songs.

Pick initial song by searching for track title, genre, artist, or album name, but the search should only return songs. Might be helpful to have a song show view that displays album and artist information.

Similar to Last.fm - User can search a song and app will play related songs. But they have ads and it’s paid. Free and ad-free are important. And the user can’t save their playlist. 

Unique, fresh, responsive, HTML5. Cool transitions. Brown. Cleanliness in design. No design elements that aren’t absolutely necessary. Minimalist.

## Nice to have:
It would be cool to be able to share with other users.
Song should not stop playing even if user clicks around on site.
Nice to have: a toolbar that persists on each page.
